# Flashcard Generator

### Overview

Node.js backend for a basic flashcard application.

Users can create two types of flashcards

1. **Basic** flashcards, which have a front (_"Who was the first president of the United States?"_), and a back (_"George Washington"_).

2. **Cloze-Deleted** flashcards, which present _partial_ text (_"... was the first president of the United States."_), and the full text when the user requests it (_"George Washington was the first president of the United States."_)

Users can also quiz themselves using the flashcards they created.
